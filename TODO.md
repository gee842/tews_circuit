# Challenges
- `challenge` 
    - [x]  Make sure to handle cancellation properly, especially when "Cancel" is chosen in the view and when the user exits out of the modal with escape. First will result in error (no detriment to user), second will insert an entry in the database with None in one of the date-time components.
    - [ ] Ensure there are checks in place to prevent double booking; a player shouldn't be able to have two matches scheduled for the same time.
    - [ ] Checks to make sure the time booked isn't in the past
    - [ ] Handle automatic disqualification by checking for matches that are past due.
- `finish_match`
    - [x] Figure out how to add buttons AFTER the user to challenge has been selected.
    - [x] If the match is with yourself or a bot, the match with yourself in it will be marked as finished.
    - [x] Add checks for when the incorrect user is selected.
    - [x] Streak bonus is applied incorrectly.
- Point calculation
    - [x] The message for point updates after a match is bad, update it.
    - [ ] Add different point calculation when vs people who are higher/lower rank than you.
- Promotion
    - [x] There is an error with Promotion. Apparently the rank is mistaken for a column in the table.
