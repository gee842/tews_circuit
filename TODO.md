- `challenge` 
    - [x]  Make sure to handle cancellation properly, especially when "Cancel" is chosen in the view and when the user exits out of the modal with escape. First will result in error (no detriment to user), second will insert an entry in the database with None in one of the date-time components.
    - [x] Ensure there are checks in place to prevent double booking; a player shouldn't be able to have two matches scheduled for the same time.
    - [x] Checks to make sure the time booked isn't in the past
        - [x] The checks should be in terms of precedence. Meaning if the month isn't the current month, skip the check for days, it's unnecessary. Because if the current date is 22nd Oct 11:43, you cannot book a match on 22nd Nov 11:43.
    - [x] Handle automatic disqualification by checking for matches that are past due.
- `finish_match`
    - [x] Figure out how to add buttons AFTER the user to challenge has been selected.
    - [x] If the match is with yourself or a bot, the match with yourself in it will be marked as finished.
    - [x] Add checks for when the incorrect user is selected.
    - [x] Streak bonus is applied incorrectly.
- Point calculation [x] The message for point updates after a match is bad, update it.
    - [x] Add different point calculation when vs people who are higher/lower rank than you.
        - [x] Problem with rank bonuses. The bonuses are applied inversly. Meaning higher ranks will earn more if they beat lower ranking players and vice versa.
            - Turns out the problem was due to the values of the enum being set incorrectly. A slight detail but something important. Fixed in [1ca7095](https://github.com/gee842/tews_circuit/commit/1ca70950e23ecdb825f256b25e025ea7ba21a1b7)
- Promotion
    - [x] There is an error with Promotion. Apparently the rank is mistaken for a column in the table.
    - [x] Rank is not properly updated. Gold -> Emerald not taken into affect (this is a side effect of [this](https://github.com/gee842/tews_circuit/commit/1ca70950e23ecdb825f256b25e025ea7ba21a1b7)).
- Cancelling matches
    - [x] Does not show the right challenger data.
        - If you're X and you run `cancel` you'll see "vs. Y at date" but if you're Y and you run the command you'll see "vs. Y at date." When it's supposed to be "vs. X at date." In addition to this, the ids are in the same position. If you're X you'll see the ID of Y, if you're Y you'll see the ID of Y.
